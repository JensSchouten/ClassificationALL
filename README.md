# ClassificationALL
These scripts were used in the paper titled "Accurate classification of blood cells in a small acute lymphoblastic leukemia dataset using convolutional neural networks" by Schouten et al. The networks were trained on a Nvidia GeForce GT 730 GPU with Python version 3.5, keras version 2.0.8 and tensorflow-GPU version 1.4.0.

## Dataset


## Scripts
In both the binary classification as multiclass classification scripts, the user input should be filled in to be able to train the networks. This includes paths to the images and labels folder and the folder to save the results.
